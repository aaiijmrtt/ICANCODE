#ICANCODE

BASH scripting: because I was bored

The code in this repository presents a simple BASH script to create a series of
empty commits in a repository which results in a pattern of characters on your
Git Contributions Graph. In case you would like to leave a message for stalkers.

**Usage**:

	You may replace "icancode" with an alternative message.

		$ sudo bash icancode.sh "icancode"

**Note**:

* Requires BASH.
* Requires git.
